                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI algorithms are trained to identify abnormalities in medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. For instance, Google's DeepMind developed an AI system that can detect over 50 types of eye diseases from retinal scans, often with greater accuracy than human specialists.</p>
                    <br><b><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pathology: </li></b>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI is being used to analyze pathology slides, assisting pathologists in detecting cancer cells and other pathological conditions. This not only speeds up the diagnostic process but also reduces the likelihood of human error.</p>
                    <br><b><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genomics: </li></b>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI tools are aiding geneticists in interpreting complex genetic data, identifying mutations that may be associated with diseases. Companies like Deep Genomics use AI to predict how genetic variations influence diseases and drug responses.</p>

                 <h5>Learn about AI’s role in treatment planning and how it helps customize medical care for individual patients.</h5>
                <h6>Treatment Planning</h6>
                 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In treatment planning, AI helps tailor medical care to individual patients. By analyzing data from electronic health records (EHRs), genetic information, and clinical trials, AI can recommend personalized treatment plans that maximize efficacy and minimize side effects.</p>
                 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, AI platforms can suggest optimal chemotherapy regimens for cancer patients based on their unique genetic makeup and response to previous treatments.</p>
                 <br><ol>
                    <b><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oncology: </li></b>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI-driven platforms such as IBM Watson for Oncology analyze patient data and medical literature to recommend personalized cancer treatment options. These systems consider a patient’s genetic profile, medical history, and the latest clinical guidelines to suggest the most effective treatment plans.</p>
                    <br><b><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardiology: </li></b>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI is used to predict the risk of cardiovascular events by analyzing data from wearables and electronic health records (EHRs). This enables cardiologists to develop customized preventive and therapeutic strategies for each patient.</p>
                    <br><b><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgery:  </li></b>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI-powered surgical robots assist surgeons in performing precise and minimally invasive procedures. Systems like the da Vinci Surgical System use AI to enhance the surgeon’s capabilities, leading to improved surgical outcomes and faster patient recovery.</p>
                </ol>

                 <h5>Explore examples of AI in personalized medicine, predicting disease risks, and recommending preventive measures.</h5>
                  <h6>Personalized Medicine</h6>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI is at the forefront of personalized medicine, where treatments are customized for individual patients rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. By integrating genetic, environmental, and lifestyle data, AI can predict a patient's risk for certain diseases and recommend preventive measures. An example is the use of AI in predicting the likelihood of diseases like diabetes or heart disease, enabling early interventions and personalized care plans.</p>
                  <br><ol>
                    <b><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmacogenomics:</li></b>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI analyzes a patient’s genetic information to predict their response to specific medications, helping doctors choose the most effective drugs with the fewest side effects. For example, AI models can predict how a patient with a certain genetic variant will metabolize a particular drug.</p>
                    <br><b><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chronic Disease Management:  </li></b>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI-driven apps and devices monitor patients’ health in real-time, providing personalized recommendations for managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma.
